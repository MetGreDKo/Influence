    <!-- Make this page the About page. Brief of what the site is about. -->

Nation simulators have been a passion of mine since 2000. I've typically played them pen and paper online in small online communities. Unfortunately as we all have gone through life we lack the time to give the games the love and affection they so deserve. The creation of this site and a new game within it is my effort to keep it alive and bring back something I had spent many hours on.
<br>
<br>
Other games of the sort have had a number of names from Super Power, Global Conflict, Defcon and Head of State being just a few I've seen in these communities. They all had a heavy emphasis on military power with significant diplomatic efforts. The concepts they all sought to explore were rudimentary due to the nature of the games being pen and paper. Here however I hope to change that.
<br>
<br>
This game is called Influence. My wish is to build the basis for a deep and complex experience in an approachable manner so that there is always something to be done to improve a nation and some way to target or otherwise attack it beyond the military. I want everything to have some impact whether on its own or coupled with other things. I essentially want to feel like it's a living world where choices matter.
<br>
<br>
Influence is a game which takes place on Earth with technology from 1900. Players can create their own nations in what ever image they desire.
